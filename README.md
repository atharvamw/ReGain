# 🏗️ ReGain – Smart Reuse Marketplace for Construction Materials  

### ♻️ Turning Extra Into Opportunity  

ReGain is a platform that helps **construction sites**, **manufacturers**, and **individuals** efficiently **reuse leftover construction materials** — saving money 💰, reducing waste 🌍, and cutting down carbon footprint 🌿.

## 🌍 Problem We’re Solving

Every construction project buys **more material than needed** — because it’s impossible to estimate perfectly.  
After completion, there’s always **extra cement, metal, bricks, wood, tiles** lying around.  

- 🚫 They can’t return it to suppliers.  
- 🚚 Transporting it elsewhere costs money.  
- 🗑️ So it’s often wasted or dumped.

Meanwhile, **other sites** nearby might be **buying the same materials at full cost** — without realizing usable materials are sitting unused right next door.  

That’s the gap **ReGain** bridges.

## 💡 Our Solution

ReGain creates a **digital marketplace** where:
- 🧱 Construction sites can **list leftover materials** (for sale or donation).  
- 🔍 Others can **browse or search nearby** using an interactive **GIS-based map**.  
- 📍 Buyers can find **closest available materials** to reduce **transport and environmental cost**.  
- 🤝 Sellers can **recover part of their investment** by selling leftovers for a fair price.  

This helps create a **circular economy** in construction — where every leftover gains new purpose.

## 🧭 How It Works

1. 🏢 **Sites Register** on the ReGain platform.  
2. 🧱 **List Extra Materials** – upload quantity, type, condition, and location.  
3. 🗺️ **GIS Map View** – shows all nearby listings with details.  
4. 👷 **Buyers Filter/Search** based on type, price, and distance.  
5. 💬 **Connect & Finalize Deal** through our communication system.  

Simple, transparent, and eco-friendly. 🌱
